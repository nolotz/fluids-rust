# Fluids-Rust: A Rust Port of Fluids Library

## What is Fluids?
Fluids is an open-source software designed for engineers and technicians in the fields of chemical, mechanical, or civil engineering. The library offers modules for various domains such as piping, fittings, pumps, tanks, compressible flow, open-channel flow, atmospheric properties, solar properties, particle size distributions, two-phase flow, friction factors, control valves, orifice plates and other flow meters, ejectors, relief valves, and many more.

Originally developed in Python, Fluids was created with the aim to serve as a low-overhead, lightweight repository of engineering knowledge and utilities relating to fluid dynamics. It was tightly integrated with SciPy and NumPy, however, over time, these became optional components utilized for a small subset of functionalities.

## About Fluids-Rust
Fluids-Rust is a port of the original Fluids library to the Rust programming language. Rust's memory-safety, concurrency, and performance characteristics make it an ideal choice for high-performance and reliable engineering software. By bringing Fluids to the Rust ecosystem, we aim to provide an efficient and robust library for fluid dynamics computations.
